# Road Accident Dashboard Project

## Overview

This repository hosts an Excel project aimed at analyzing road accident data for the years 2021 and 2022. The project's primary objective is to provide insights into road safety by creating a comprehensive dashboard that meets the following key performance indicators (KPIs):

### Primary KPIs

1. **Total Casualties Post-Accident:** Offering an overview of the overall impact of road accidents.

2. **Total Casualties and Percentage by Accident Severity:** Providing insights into the relationship between accident severity and resulting casualties, along with percentage distribution.

3. **Maximum Casualties by Type of Vehicle:** Identifying vehicle types most commonly associated with high casualties.

### Secondary KPIs

4. **Total Casualties by Vehicle Type:** Analyzing casualties based on different vehicle types, highlighting potential safety concerns for specific vehicle categories.

5. **Monthly Casualty Trends - Current Year vs. Previous Year:** Showing a monthly comparison of casualties for the current year and the preceding year, enabling trend and pattern identification.

6. **Maximum Casualties by Road Type:** Highlighting road types where maximum casualties occur, providing crucial data for infrastructure and safety improvements.

7. **Distribution of Casualties by Road Surface:** Examining road surface conditions concerning the distribution of total casualties, influencing safety recommendations.

8. **Casualties by Area/Location and Day/Night:** Establishing relationships between casualties, geographic area/location, and time of day (day/night), enabling targeted interventions.
